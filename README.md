# Obesity Risk Prediction

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This project was a part of the Kaggle Playground Series Season 4 Episode 1 at Kaggle and a part of my gaining knowledge and portfolio. This project is about obesity risk classification. The dataset that I used has 17 variables and 1 target variable, which contains 7 classes. I used 3 machine learning models, compare it, and make a prediction using the model who get the best accuracy.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

You can open this project on your computer. There are some ways to open this project.

### Prerequisites

<ol>
    <li>Download this .ipynb file (version 3.0) and download the dataset on the dataset folder (dataset/train.csv and dataset/test.csv)</li>
    <li>Save that on your local storage.</li>
    <li>If you use Jupyter Notebook, make sure that you have already install matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, and yellowbrick packages. To install those packages:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Matplotlib</li>
        conda install matplotlib
        <li>Seaborn</li>
        conda install seaborn
        <li>Scikit-learn</li>
        conda create -n sklearn-env -c conda-forge scikit-learn
        <br>
        conda activate sklearn-env
        <li>Yellowbrick</li>
        conda install -c districdatalabs yellowbrick
    </ul>
</ol>

### Jupyter Notebook

<ol>
    <li>Make sure that you have already install python on your computer.</li>
    <li>Head over to <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">anaconda.com</a> and download the latest version of Anaconda.</li>
    <li>Install Anaconda and launch them after the installation is complete.</li>
    <li>Click on the Install Jupyter Notebook button.</li>
    <li>After the installation is complete, click on Launch button to launch Jupyter Notebook.</li>
    <li>Import or upload this project to Jupyter and open it.</li>
    <li>You may scroll down to loading dataset section. You need to change the directory for the train dataset (train.csv) with your local directory.</li>
    <li>You also have to scroll down to testing section. You need to change the directory for the test dataset (test.csv) with your local directory.</li>
</ol>

### Google Colab

<ol>
    <li>Open <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/">Google Colab</a>.</li>
    <li>Click Upload button.</li>
    <li>You can import this project by dragging it into the box or by browse file by clicking the Browse button.</li>
    <li>Import the dataset into Colab.</li>
    <li>This project is ready to use.</li>
</ol>
